  <h1>Reading Response #1</h1>
  <h2>In Plato’s Cave – Susan Sontag</h2>

  <p>
  To capture a moment, to me, is to capture someone’s experience and emotions within a frame. A photograph freezes a split second in time, but that moment can carry so much meaning. It allows people to feel what the photographer felt when they pressed the shutter. Viewers can interpret body language, facial expressions, and social cues, making the image personal in their own way. Photography gives space for emotion without forcing an explanation.
Graphic design works in a similar way, but with more structure. It gives people a creative outlet to either send a message or create art that reflects their interests, values, or identity. Design can be loud or subtle, direct or abstract, but it always communicates something. Whether intentional or not, images influence how we think, feel, and react.
In In Plato’s Cave, Susan Sontag highlights how images today are constantly forced into our lives and designed to pull our attention. She explains how photography once held more weight and meaning, especially when cameras were rare and images were treated as evidence. Now, photographs are everywhere, often taken without thought or responsibility. A photo does not support every side of a story—it only shows one angle. What we see depends on where the camera is placed and who is behind it.
The world has many problems that cannot be solved overnight. Change requires patience, understanding, and empathy toward one another. I believe photography and design can be used to push messages across different generations and perspectives. Speaking to people through art is something many pioneers have done and made into their identity. All it takes is one person to set a standard for the next generation.
For people searching for direction, photography can be a guide. It can show them a version of themselves they have never seen before, placing them in a new lens or environment. I appreciate how raw photography can be—there do not need to be captions or explanations. A single image can say a million things on its own.
When there is destruction, suffering, violence, or death, simply hearing about it often does not create enough emotional response. Images allow humanity to sympathize with one another. They force us to confront reality instead of avoiding it. Too often, we get caught up in expectations and standards and forget basic human decency and emotion.
As a media maker, I feel it would be my responsibility to highlight both the best and worst parts of humanity. Doing so can encourage critical thinking and remind people to consider the feelings of others. There are many media outlets that exploit images for profit without caring who gets hurt in the process. In Plato’s Cave also shows how the camera can become a form of escape. During conflict, the photographer becomes a mediator—a messenger delivering truths the world needs to see, even when they are uncomfortable.
