  <p>
  I am interested in creative expression and learning visual media and digital communication. 
  My work explores how images and design can communicate to viewers are connect with them clearly and emotionally. 
  I am especially interested in how digital tools and different methods are used in our everyday life.

  In my process I want to focus on creativity and experimentation. I enjoy working with 
  images because they allow me to express ideas that can be difficult to explain with words 
  alone. Visual elements such as composition, color, and texture guide attention and shape 
  how a message can be heard Through this process, I aim to create work that feels 
  approachable, thoughtful, and personal.

  As I continue learning web development and graphic communication, I want to improve my 
  technical skills while also strengthening my creative voice. I am interested in combining 
  design and storytelling in ways that are accessible and engaging. This course gives me the 
  opportunity to experiment with new tools and build confidence in presenting my work digitally.
