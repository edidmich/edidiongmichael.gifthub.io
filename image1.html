<h1>1920 x 1080 Image</h1>

<p>
I selected this image because of its strong use of leading lines and framing.
The hallway directs the viewer’s eye toward the elevator, creating depth.
Cropping to 1920x1080 strengthened the cinematic composition and improved balance.
Adjusting the tonal range increased contrast and enhanced visual clarity.
